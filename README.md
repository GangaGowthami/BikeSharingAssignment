## Problem Statement

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has a daily dataset on the rental bikes based on various environmental and seasonal settings. It wishes to use this data to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market and come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown due to corona pandemic comes to an end.

Essentially, the company wants to know â€”
Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.

# steps Performed

Step 1:Data understanding and exploration
Step 2:Data Visualisation
Step 3:Data preparation
Step 4:Model building and evaluation(Scaling)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

# Conclusion
Thus, for the model with 8 variables, the r-squared on training and test data is about 80.2% and 78.52% respectively. The adjusted r-squared on the train set is about 79.9%.
